Under U.S. copyright law, data (i.e. a collection of facts) is not eligible to copyright protection (see https://sco.library.emory.edu/research-data-management/publishing/copyright-data.html), and as IDS descriptions for CJK ideographs are facts not original creative compositions, IDS sequences in themselves are not eligible for copyright protection (that is to say, you could no more copyright 彼 = ⿰彳皮 than you could copyright 1 + 1 = 2). Therefore, anyone is free to make use of the IDS data provided in this file for personal or commercial purposes without asking permission or providing attribution. I furthermore waive any copyright claims to the presentation format of the IDS data used in this file, so anyone is free to fork the file, or use it as the basis for a new IDS data set.
