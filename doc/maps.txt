maps.json
~~~~~~~~~

This file contains character (or code point) mappings.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

maps [object]

  The value is a JSON object whose names are map names and values are
  JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

    char_to_char, char_to_seq, char_to_empty, seq_to_char, seq_to_seq,
    seq_to_empty [object?]

      Mapping entries, if any, represented as a JSON object whose
      names are "from" sequence of code points and values are "to"
      sequences of code points.  They are classified by numbers of
      "from" and "to" code points as follows:

                         "from"    "to"
        char_to_char     1         1
        char_to_seq      1         > 1
        char_to_empty    1         0
        seq_to_char      > 1       1
        seq_to_seq       > 1       > 1
        seq_to_empty     > 1       0
