scripts.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |data/scripts.json| data file contains a list of various scripts.

* Data structure

The file contains a JSON object with a name/value pair, whose name is
|scripts| and value is a JSON object.

The JSON object contains name/value pairs representing scripts.  Names
are short identifiers for the scripts and values are their
descriptions.  Names are opaque strings and they should not be
considered as significant.

Each value is a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  collation_reorder [string?]

    The value for the script which can be used in reorder_code
    <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-collation.html#Script_Reordering>,
    if any.  Note that |Zxxx| can also be used as synonym for |others|
    although it is not explicitly shown in the JSON data (as the
    |collation_reorder| value is |others|).  The value is also used
    for the |kr| key in BCP 47 "U" extension.

  desc

    If a value is specified, it is a JSON array containing short
    descriptions (JSON strings) of the script, taken from IANA BCP 47
    registry.

  ianareg [string?]

    The "YYYY-MM-DD" representation of the date the script is
    registered with the IANA BCP 47 registry.  See |iso| field for the
    registered value.

  iso [string?]

    The ISO 15924 script code for the script, in titlecased canonical
    form.  This is also the value used in BCP 47 language tags.

  u_nu [string?]

    The LDML identifier for the numbering system, in lowercase
    canonical form, if it is a numbering system and there is an
    identifier assigned.  The value can be used as the type for the
    |nu| key in BCP 47 "U" extension.  If the numbering system shares
    the same identifier with the (non-number) script, they are merged
    in same object in this JSON data file.

  u_nu_desc [string?]

    The short description for the numbering system, taken from the
    Unicode registry for BCP 47 "U" extension, if it is a numbering
    system and there is an identifier (i.e. |u_nu| has a string
    value).

  unicode [string?]

    The Unicode Script Property Value for the script, if any.

  unicode_id [string?]

    Classification of the script in Unicode's identifier syntax.  If
    specified, one of following values:

      excluded      "Candidate Characters for Exclusions from Identifiers"
      recommended   "Recommended Scripts"
      aspirational  "Aspirational Use Scripts"
      limited       "Limited Use Scripts"

    Note that the table for Candidate Characters for Exclusions from
    Identifiers does also contain characters selected by conditions
    other than their scripts.

  xforms [string?]

    The script token for the script, used in XForms |inputmode|
    attribute <http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/#mode-scripts>, if any.
