This file contains list of character names.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pair:

  code_to_name [object]

    A JSON object whose names are code points and values are their
    names.  Code points are represented by four or more uppercase
    hexadecimal digits.  Values are JSON objects with following
    name/value pairs:

      name [string?]

        The character name for the code point, if any.

      correction, control, alternate, figment, abbreviation [object?]

        Character name aliases with the given type, as in
        NameAliases.txt.  Values are JSON objects whose names are
        alias names and values are boolean true values.

      label [string?]

        The code point label for the code point, without "<" and ">",
        if any.

    Note that character names beginning with "CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-"
    and code points whose labels begin with "private-use-",
    "surrogate-", or "reserved-" are not included in this object.

  code_seq_to_name [object]

    A JSON object whose names are code point sequences and values are
    their names.  Code point names are represented as SPACE-separated
    list of code points.  Values are JSON objects with following
    name/value pair:

      name [string]

        The name of the named character sequence represented by the
        code points.

  range_to_prefix [object]

    A JSON object whose names are code point ranges and values are
    their name prefixes.  Code point ranges are inclusive and are
    represented by two code points, separated by a SPACE character.
    Values are JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

      name [string?]

        The prefix for the character names in the range, if any.

      label [string?]

        The prefix for the code point labels in the range, without "<"
        and ">", if any.

    The object contains ranges for CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPHS, private use
    code points, and surrogate code points.  Names and prefixes are to
    be followed by code points represented by four or more uppercase
    hexadecimal digits.

This file contains names or labels of all code points in the range
U+0000 and U+10FFFF, except for reserved (unassigned) code points,
either in |code_to_name| or in |range_to_prefix|.  The character name,
if any, or code point label or a code point can be obtained by
following steps:

  1. Let /code/ be the code point in question.

  2. If |json.code_to_name[code].name ||
     json.code_to_name[code].label| has a value, return it and abort
     these steps.

  3. If there is /key/ in |range_to_prefix| where the range includes
     /code/ and |json.range_to_prefix[code].name ||
     json.range_to_prefix[code].label| has a value, return it followed
     by four or more uppercase hexadecimal digits representing /code/
     and abort these steps.

  4. Return |reserved-| followed by four or more uppercase hexadecimal
     digits representing /code/ and abort these steps.
